MedQuery is an AI-based web application designed to assist users in understanding their health symptoms and receiving preliminary medical guidance. By integrating natural language processing with trusted medical databases, MedQuery offers intelligent insights and suggests appropriate types of specialists, enhancing healthcare accessibility and user awareness.

Features
AI-powered symptom analysis using GPT API

Personalized specialist recommendations based on detected symptoms

Integration with trusted medical APIs such as PubMed and DrugBank

Natural language interface allowing users to describe symptoms conversationally

Context-aware response system for improved accuracy and relevance

Lightweight, privacy-focused design that avoids storing personal health data

System Architecture
MedQuery follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

User Interface: A clean, responsive front end built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React)

Application Layer: Manages user requests, logic handling, and communication with external services

GPT API Integration: Interprets user-described symptoms using advanced natural language understanding

External APIs:

PubMed: For referencing relevant research articles and symptom data

DrugBank: For retrieving drug and treatment-related information

Backend (Optional): May include database logging for anonymous analytics and improvement

How It Works
The user enters symptoms in plain English through the web interface.

The input is processed using the GPT model to extract relevant medical context.

MedQuery queries external APIs to cross-reference symptoms and potential conditions.

The system responds with possible causes, types of specialists to consult, and links to further reading.
